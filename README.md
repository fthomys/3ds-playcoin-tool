3DSx Play Coin Setter Mod
========

Allows Ninjhax users to modify the 3DS's play coin counter, in other words providing infinite play coins.

Usage is self-explanatory, just choose the number of coins you want from the list, then exit using B. No more than 300 coins can be held at a time, this is a system limit. An option is also available to backup and restore the decrypted gamecoin.dat to the SD card, however this is not likely to be useful to anybody.

This mod allows to read the current amount of coins and allows to set a custom vaule

Note that this code is simply a modification of yellows8's [3ds_homemenu_extdatatool](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenu_extdatatool) and MrCheese's [3DSx Play Coin Setter](https://github.com/MrCheeze/playcoin), which contains within it code to modify arbitrary 3ds extdata.
